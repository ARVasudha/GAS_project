</p>Point-of-sale systems are critical to the efficient operation of a food or drink retail establishment. These software systems help to keep track of cash, sales and inventory. However, many systems are prohibitively expensive for new businesses. By building your own system with an easy and free backend like Google Sheets, you can start your business with fewer upfront costs. Also, by building your own point of sale, you can customize the interface to fit your business model, rather than using a premade mass-produced system that may have features you do not need.</p>
